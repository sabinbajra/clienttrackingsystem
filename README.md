# Elaboration
Clients for an organisation can be the existing staff members, and the potential customers. This will keep the up to date data about these.
### Clients can be of 3 types:
Who is already engaged with the organisation
Who was engaged but left
### Potentials clients
This CTS will help to follow up the clients, make ease on contacting which is the follow up process.

Potential clients can also be categorised as per the level of potentiality:
1. Highly Interested
2. Moderate Interested
3. Less interested
Clients - > Interest
Clients - > Availabilities

We can also know about which client is interested in which product/service of the organisation. The client availabilities and lots of information to which the organisation can use to convert the potential clients to engaged clients.
Feature add up could be messaging, alerting system users to follow up etc.
Admin panel will be separate for all the client information management like creating, update and deleting. These are some functionality I would like to work on with future scalability like adding billing system, messaging system.
